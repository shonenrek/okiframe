# okiframe

The Okiframe is a hybrid arcade controller, designed to combine a stickless controller with a traditional arcade controller. The layout is heavily inspired by that of Hit Box Arcade's Cross|Up controller, but I did not intentionally copy any techniques they have used.

The core of the Okiframe is a teensy 4.0 microcontroller, chosen purely for how many inputs it has. The firmware is a mess and needs revising, but works most of the time with Steam Input on PC. It has not been tested on any console as of yet.

The layout was designed with Suzo Happ/Industrias Lorenzo 28MM buttons because I had many on-hand and I decided to build the initial unit in a thick wooden enclosure. The layout could be modified to support Japanese 30MM buttons, and indeed might be at a later date.
